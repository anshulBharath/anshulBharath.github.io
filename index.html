                Thank you for stopping by! My name is Anshul Bharath. I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science at the 
                <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target="_blank">University of St. Thomas.</a>
                 
                I am currently working at
                <a href="https://www.starkey.com/" target="_blank">Starkey Labs</a>
                as a Software Engineer Intern.
              </p>
              <p>
                I get asked why I wanted to study Computer Science and what made me interested in this field. I like to joke around 
                and say that Tony Stark inspired me, but I can't give all the credit to him. Growing up I had a lot of influence from my parents. 
                They allowed me to see the great possibilities, that a career in Software Development could hold. 
                At the end of the day I got into this field for the love of solving problems. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time I engage myself in many other activities outside of computer science. Growing up I played tennis and continued 
                to play in college. This last summer, I picked up road biking and enjoy that. I enjoy playing the piano and listening
                to classical music. Finally, I love reading. I like to keep a few books going and my booklist is never ending! 
              </p>
              <p>
                In the future, I hope to be traveling the world as I work and hopefully documenting my experiences, so stay tuned. Cheers! - Anshul
